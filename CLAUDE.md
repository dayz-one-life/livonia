# CLAUDE.md

This project was created from the Claude Code workflow template. The workflow below is
enforced by committed hooks in `.claude/` and streamlined by repo-level skills.

## What this repo is

A DayZ server mission for the **Livonia (Enoch)** map, based on the vanilla
"Road to Badlands" mission. The repo root holds the mission files that a DayZ
server loads:

- **Central economy** — `db/` (`types.xml`, `events.xml`, `economy.xml`, `globals.xml` — server-wide economy/loot tuning vars such as `LootDamageMin`/`LootDamageMax`, `messages.xml`), `cfgeconomycore.xml`, `cfgspawnabletypes.xml`, `cfglimitsdefinition*.xml`, `cfgrandompresets.xml`.
- **Map groups & spawns** — `mapgroupproto.xml`, `mapgrouppos.xml`, `mapgroupcluster*.xml`, `mapgroupdirt.xml`, `mapclusterproto.xml`, `cfgeventspawns.xml`, `cfgeventgroups.xml`, `cfgplayerspawnpoints.xml`.
- **Environment** — `env/` (animal/infected territory definitions), `cfgenvironment.xml`, `cfgweather.xml`, `cfgeffectarea.json`, `areaflags.map`, `cfgundergroundtriggers.json`.
- **Gameplay/misc** — `cfggameplay.json`, `cfgignorelist.xml`, `init.c` (server-side mission logic).
- **Custom presets** — `custom/` holds files referenced from config, e.g. `custom/loadout.json` (spawn-gear preset wired in via `cfggameplay.json` → `spawnGearPresetFiles`).

Tweaks to the mission are made on `feature/*` branches per the workflow below.

## On session start

A SessionStart hook injects a role-aware orientation. **Present that orientation to the
user at the start of a fresh session.**

## The workflow

1. All feature work happens on a **fork**, on a `feature/*` branch.
2. Updating this file (`CLAUDE.md`) is the **last step** before opening a PR.
3. `CHANGELOG.md` is updated on **every** PR.
4. PRs go into the canonical repo's **`develop`** branch.
5. Reviews are done in Claude Code and posted back to the contributor.
6. Approved PRs are **squash-merged** into `develop`.
7. Production releases go out via a **`develop` → `main`** PR.
8. Merging that PR **cuts a release** with notes.

## Skills

- Contributor: `starting-work`, `finishing-a-feature`.
- Maintainer: `reviewing-a-contribution`, `merging-a-contribution`, `drafting-a-release`, `cutting-a-release`.
- Setup: `workflow-setup` (run once).

## Guardrails (enforced by `.claude/hooks/guard.py`)

- No commits, pushes, or merges on `main`/`develop` (tag pushes and the one-time `workflow.json` setup commit are exempt).
- On a fork: PRs must target `develop` and require CHANGELOG.md + CLAUDE.md updates.
- On the canonical repo: feature work is blocked (fork instead). Fork contributions into `develop` must be squash-merged and approved; the maintainer's own same-repo release/back-merge PRs are exempt from that gate.
- Once the project is initialized (`workflow-setup` run), write/git actions are blocked unless the Superpowers plugin is installed.
- **Solo maintainer mode:** setting `soloMaintainer: true` in `.claude/workflow.json` activates a `solo` role that holds the union of contributor + maintainer permissions from a single clone (no remote swapping). Protected branches stay PR-only; contribution merges into `develop` still require `--squash` + a posted review (a `COMMENTED` review counts, since self-approval is impossible); release (`develop`→`main`) and back-merge (`main`→`develop`) PRs are exempt from the changelog/review gates. Off by default.

## Honest limitations

- Hooks only bind inside Claude Code; plain `git`/`gh` in a shell bypasses them.
- Superpowers/role detection are filesystem/remote heuristics; they fail with clear messages.
- Approved-review detection needs the canonical repo to be a real GitHub remote.

## Configuration

`.claude/workflow.json` holds `canonicalRepo`, branch names, the optional `soloMaintainer` flag (default `false`), and optional `commands.test`/`commands.lint`.
